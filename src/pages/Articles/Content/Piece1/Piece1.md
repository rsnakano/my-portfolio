#Making a Portfolio

##*Note: The first part of this website (without the articles section) was built around August 2020*
##*The second part was built on March 2021*

      In the midst of the pandemic that suspended classes for almost half a year by then,
my organization, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), wanted to take that time
to build the organization's official website. To do this, they wanted to get volunteers
to be trained by a senior member on web development (front end), so I volunteered.
Our whole training was basically a hands-on experience, since after a brief session explaining
the basics, we were given a week to build our own online portfolio, using HTML/CSS and
ReactJS. I have to admit, I was both scared and excited, since this was my first foray into
front-end web development, but I welcomed the challenge.

##Planning
    With the ol' pen & paper and virtually no drawing skills, I started off planning the design.
I looked up different portfolios online to get some inspiration and decided in the end
to opt for a more minimalistic look (totally not because it would've taken the least
amount of effort) with yellow/blacke as the main colors. I didn't get to save the paper
that I drew the initial design on, but the final design more or less reflected the original
one pretty well. The next step was to figure out how to actually implement the design using
HTML/CSS.

##Implementation
    I divided up the original design into three parts: The main part of the page, the part
that users will get to see first, the About Me part, where I'll get to display my boring
hobbies, almost non-existent skills, a short description about myself, and a barren Projects
part—all for the world (but mostly my future employer) to see, yippee. I decided to focus
on one part at a time, breaking down the whole page in small bits that I could work on.

    The main part of the page was, in hindsight, not the hardest part to implement. However,
since I was inexperienced and it was the very first part I had to work with, it probably
took the longest time to get right. Upon hardcoding the values, my mentor quickly taught
me the importance of webpage flexibility and flexbox. The goal here was to make the page
adapt and look good in a lot of screens. After getting that done, I started gaining momentum.
With the help of my mentor and the power of stack overflow, w3schools, geeksforgeeks, and a
whole slew of other websites, I managed to get the rest of the parts done. The problems I
got to encounter were nothing too big—most were just general styling questions (How do I
center this within this, etc.), which I guess would be the same problems front-end web devs
face.

    During building, I realized that I also had to create a navbar and a footer, as most
pages implement. I built the footer with relative ease, followed a tutorial for the navbar
and got that down pretty quickly. At last, the final—or at least the first serviceable
version—was complete. I generated the build for the project and used surge for the
hosting. It was finally up and ready, with a couple of days to spare before the week ended.

##Updating
    After a few months, and during a week-long break from university, I wanted to extend my
portfolio and add more than a single page. I wanted to add a blog-style 'Articles' page
to share some of my thoughts and experiences, relating to my field. Designing the new page
didn't take long, but implementing the ability to route different pages was quite tricky.
After getting that functionality down, I refactored parts of the code, organized media files
and compartmentalized parts in general. Afterwards, I implemented the Articles page and posted
the two first, and hopefully not the last, articles (including this one) on my portfolio.

##Last thoughts
    Looking back, I had a really fun time doing this portfolio. There were ups and downs, but I loved
the experience. Most importantly though, more than just gaining valuable technical skills and know-how,
I had a chance to look inward and thought about what and who I was as a programmer, and helped
me gain confidence on marketing my skills. I don't know if I'll be updating this article if I
update the site in the future, but I'm sure I'll use a lot of stack overflow and
it'll look awesome.
